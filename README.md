DNA strand translator (21 genes)


The following code was generated only for "knowledge testing" based on a biology activity.
The process of gene translation consists of joining amino acids according to the codon sequence of the messenger RNA. Codon is a crack of nitrogenous bases of the mRNA, which has its complementary crack (anticodon) in the corresponding RNA transporter.
